# Shell-example-Convert-jpeg-images-to-png-images

The first shell script jpg2png.sh which converts all images in JPEG format in the current directory to PNG format.
You can assume that JPEG files and only JPEG files have the suffix jpg.
If the conversion is succesful the JPEG file should be removed.
Your script should stop with an appropriate error message and exit status if the PNG file already exists. 

There is an example below:

You can download JPEG images in issues.

Second shell script email_image.sh which given a list of image files as arguments displays them one-by-one. After the user has viewed each image the script should prompt the user for an e-mail address. If the user does enter an email address, the script should prompt the user for a message to accompany the image and then send the image to e-mail address. to that address. 

There is an example below:

$ ./email_image.sh penguins.png treefrog.png
Address to e-mail this image to? yangyang01011001@gmail.com
Message to accompany image? I like penguins!
penguins.png send to yangyang01011001@gmail.com
Address to e-mail this image to? yangyang01011001@gmail.com
Message to accompany image? I like tree frog!
treefrog.png send to yangyang01011001@gmail.com
